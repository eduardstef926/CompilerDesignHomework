Documentation:
Here we have the code for implementing the deterministic finite automata algorithm.
The algorithm will split the string and put the values into 4 hashSets and when
we choose print on the menu we are going to print all the values into those hashsets.
When we check a sequence we check if the sequence is deterministic or not and then
we check if it is the transition of the states and sequence exist (pair<int,int>)
