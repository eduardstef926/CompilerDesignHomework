Implement a scanner (lexical analyzer): Implement the scanning algorithm and use ST from lab 2 for the symbol table.

My scanner class uses regex to match different types of tokens. It uses my implementation of ST from the previous lab and
also implements the pif. Details about implementation are found in javadoc.
